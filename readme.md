# Guessing Game

Fun for the whole retro family!

## Project Layout

[./client](./client) contains the client side (browser) portion of application code.

[./server](./server) contains the server side (backend) portion of application code.

[./scripts](./scripts) contains project-wide scripts which are useful to integrate and run the client and server together.

## Node version

For now, we're standardizing on Node 20 (v20.18.0, the latest LTS version) for 
both client and server. This may change later, but for now it simplifies 
environment management to have them be the same.
